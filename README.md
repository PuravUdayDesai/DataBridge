# Project Topic
Develop and devise a web-based C2C E-Commerce Data Marketplace
# Problem Domain
Public consumers, content streaming/delivery platforms, small and large content creators.
# Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s world, information can take many forms. It can be text, image, audio, or video. There are many platforms or applications where we can get the privilege of consuming the information. It is not only distribution based on category, but we also need to surf through different platforms to find content within a category. Consequently, finding the content we want has become more challenging, and we must often search for it. In addition, the charge to consume content varies depending on the fee imposed by the content provider. Additionally, smaller content creators have difficulty generating an immediate income and setting up an IT infrastructure. It is common for consumers to struggle with not just managing their finances, but also managing their subscriptions and searching for the content, which results in a loss of consumers, delivery platforms, and content creators.
